## Past

Last year I have contributed to :

-   [`texor` package](https://github.com/Abhi-1U/texor) : To automate manual conversion processes for legacy RJournal Articles from LaTeX to web format(Rmarkdown).
-   [`rebib` package](https://github.com/Abhi-1U/rebib) : Tools to Convert and Aggregate Bibliographies
-   A patch of code to `rjtools`
-   Lots of [Lua Filters](https://github.com/Abhi-1U/tex-lua-filters) for pandoc

## Present

As of now I am :

-   [Preparing](https://github.com/Abhi-1U/rebib/issues/12) one of the packages for CRAN
-   working on a [Github actions workflow](https://github.com/Abhi-1U/texor-ghactions) for easier conversion of articles
-   Ton of fixes and documentation updates
-   Having Fun while doing that ðŸ™‚

## Future

I expect to do more things like :

- Get my other package to CRAN
- Convert the Legacy article Issues to Web and deploy them
- Write an Article to inform more potential authors about this package
- Improvements to the packages

# Any Questions ?

# Thank You !
